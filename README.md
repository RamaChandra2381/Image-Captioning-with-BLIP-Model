**Image Captioning with BLIP Model**

**Description:**

  This repository demonstrates how to use the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) model to generate automatic captions for images. The model is hosted on Hugging Face and is implemented using the Transformers library. This code allows you to load an image, process it, and generate a descriptive caption using the Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base pre-trained model.
  

**Key Features:**
1. Automatic Image Captioning: Generate descriptive captions for images using a pre-trained deep-learning model.
2. Image Display: The script displays the image in the notebook environment (using the IPython's display function) before generating the caption.

3 . Pre-trained Model: Utilizes the Hugging Face Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base model for image captioning.

4. Error Handling: Includes error handling for files not found and other potential issues.

5. Easy Setup: Works seamlessly on Google Colab or any local environment with the necessary dependencies.


**Usage:**
1. Upload an image to the Colab environment (or specify a local image path).

2 .Run the script to display the image and generate a text description for it.

3. View the generated caption printed below the image.
